# inl-oci
The INL OCI repository contains the files required to build out (or terraform) the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). There are two types of files 1) those used by OKIT to be exported to OCI Resource Manager; and 2) HashCorp Control Language (HCL) files for building OCI stacks. OKIT files are JSON structured files ending in .json extension. OCI Stacks are ZIPFILES containing HCL structured files ending in .tf extension; and optionally organized into directories.
